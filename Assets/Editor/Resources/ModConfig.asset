  description: 'I bet you never thought about which modules used "port plates" and
    not just ports.


    Using pairs of colors and encoded flashes, find which module is being described,
    then submit its name.


    oh btw this only supports centi modules but. i''ll open source so. yall can add
    more if you want. figured centi was a good start.
